# Number Machine

This project implements a number machine that accepts a five-digit number and performs three transformations on it:

1. Reverses the number.
2. Calculates the sum of its digits.
3. Generates a new number by adding 1 to each of its digits.

The program helps illustrate basic number manipulation using modulus and integer division operations.

## Usage

### Calling the Function

To use the `number_machine` function, you need to pass a five-digit integer as an argument. The function will then perform the three operations on the number and display the results.

### Example :

```python
number_machine(54321)
```

outputs:

```python
Reversed Number from 54321: 12345
Sum of digits of 54321 is: 15
New Number created from 54321 is: 65432
```
